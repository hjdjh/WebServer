In this spirit he began the attack, and by animated74 perseverance75 had soon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry, of flirtation76, which bounded his views; but in triumphing over the discretion77 which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them both, he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more strong than he had supposed. She loved him; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly78 dear to her. He was entangled79 by his own vanity, with as little excuse of love as possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her cousin.

After what had passed to wound and alienate89 the two families, the continuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood would have been most distressing90; but the absence of the latter, for some months purposely lengthened91, ended very fortunately in the necessity, or at least the practicability, of a permanent removal. Dr. Grant, through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded to a stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those who went and those who staid.
